following clean architecture principles. These services handle technical concerns
and external integrations while implementing domain interfaces.

Service Categories:
- Authentication: JWT tokens, sessions, OAuth, password encryption
- Email: Email delivery and template rendering
- Events: Domain event publishing and handling
- Password Reset: Token generation and email delivery
