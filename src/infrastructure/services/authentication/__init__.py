"""Infrastructure Authentication Services.

This module provides concrete implementations of authentication infrastructure services
following clean architecture principles. These services handle technical concerns
like JWT token management, session storage, OAuth provider integration, and
password encryption.

Infrastructure Services:
- Token Service: JWT token creation, validation, and lifecycle management
- Session Service: User session management with Redis and PostgreSQL
- OAuth Service: External OAuth provider integration (Google, Microsoft, Facebook) 
- Password Encryption Service: Defense-in-depth password hash encryption

These services implement domain interfaces and are injected into domain services
through the dependency injection container, following the dependency inversion principle.
