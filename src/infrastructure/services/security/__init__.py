"""Infrastructure Security Services.

This module provides concrete implementations of security infrastructure services
following clean architecture principles. These services handle technical concerns
like field-level encryption and data protection.

Services:
- Field Encryption Service: Encrypts sensitive token family data for secure storage

All services implement domain interfaces and are injected through dependency
injection containers, following the dependency inversion principle.

Key Features:
- Base Infrastructure Service: Common functionality for all services
- Structured logging with service context
- Standardized error handling and conversion
- Security context validation
- Configuration management
