"""Domain Security Services.

This module provides domain services related to security and authorization concerns
following Domain-Driven Design principles. These services encapsulate business logic
around password policies, authorization policies, and security validations.

Security Domain Services:
- Password Policy Validator: Enforces password strength requirements and business rules
- Policy Service: Manages authorization policies with ABAC support and audit trails

These services are pure domain logic without infrastructure dependencies.
