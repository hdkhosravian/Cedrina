"""Infrastructure service interfaces for cross-cutting concerns.

This module defines the infrastructure service interfaces following Domain-Driven
Design principles. These interfaces encapsulate the business logic for caching,
event publishing, and other cross-cutting infrastructure concerns.

Key DDD Principles Applied:
- Single Responsibility: Each interface has one clear purpose
- Ubiquitous Language: Interface names reflect business domain concepts
- Dependency Inversion: Domain depends on abstractions, not concretions
- Bounded Context: All interfaces belong to the infrastructure domain
- Interface Segregation: Clients depend only on interfaces they use

Infrastructure Domain Services:
- Event Publisher: Domain event publishing and distribution
- Cache Service: Generic caching operations and management
