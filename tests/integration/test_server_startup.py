"""Integration Test for Server Startup

This module contains integration tests to verify that the FastAPI server can start correctly
without encountering import errors, configuration issues, or other startup failures.
These tests simulate running the server with Uvicorn to ensure the application loads properly.

Tests:
    - test_server_startup: Verifies that the server can start and respond to a basic request.
