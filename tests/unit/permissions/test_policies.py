Unit Tests for Casbin Policy Management

This module contains unit tests for the policy management functions defined in src/permissions/policies.py.
These functions allow dynamic addition and removal of access control policies at runtime, enabling flexible
permission updates without modifying static policy files. The tests cover policy addition, removal, duplicate
handling, and edge cases to ensure reliable policy management.

Tests:
    - test_add_policy_success: Verifies that a new policy can be added successfully.
    - test_add_policy_duplicate: Tests behavior when adding a policy that already exists.
    - test_remove_policy_success: Verifies that an existing policy can be removed successfully.
    - test_remove_policy_nonexistent: Tests behavior when attempting to remove a policy that does not exist.
    - test_add_and_remove_policy_cycle: Tests the full cycle of adding a policy, verifying access, removing it, and verifying denial.
