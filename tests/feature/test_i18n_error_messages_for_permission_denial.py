    Scenario: Internationalization of permission denial error messages.
    Context: Users from different locales should receive permission denial messages in their language.
    Steps:
        1. Test access to an endpoint that the user doesn't have permission for.
        2. Test access with a user in English locale, verify error message in English.
        3. Test access with a user in Spanish locale, verify error message in Spanish. 
        4. Test access with a user in Arabic locale, verify error message in Arabic.
