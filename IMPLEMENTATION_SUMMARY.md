## 🔐 Enterprise Security Implementation

### Defense-in-Depth Layers
1. **Layer 1:** bcrypt hashing with salt (existing) → Password complexity protection
2. **Layer 2:** AES-256-GCM encryption (new) → Database compromise protection  
3. **Layer 3:** Key separation from database → Key security isolation
4. **Layer 4:** Authenticated encryption → Tamper detection capability
5. **Layer 5:** Unique IV per encryption → Pattern analysis prevention
6. **Layer 6:** API rate limiting → Brute force attack protection
7. **Layer 7:** Input validation → Injection attack prevention
8. **Layer 8:** Error standardization → Information disclosure prevention
9. **Layer 9:** Timing normalization → Timing attack resistance
10. **Layer 10:** Audit logging → Security monitoring and compliance

### 🔒 Security Features Implemented

**Password Encryption Service (`PasswordEncryptionService`):**
- AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption
- Unique IV/nonce for each encryption operation
- Format versioning with "enc_v1:" prefix for future upgrades
- Migration compatibility detection
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Value Objects Enhanced:**
- `Password`: Strong password policy enforcement
- `HashedPassword`: Support for both encrypted/unencrypted formats
- `EncryptedPassword`: Type-safe encrypted password handling

**Authentication Service:**
- `UserAuthenticationWithEncryptionService`: Password encryption integration
- `UserAuthenticationSecurityService`: Security logging and monitoring
- Full backward compatibility with existing unencrypted hashes
