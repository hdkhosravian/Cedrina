# Clean Architecture Implementation for Authentication System

This document describes the comprehensive implementation of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and clean architecture principles in the Cedrina authentication system. The system has been completely refactored to follow strict DDD principles with no business logic in the API layer.

## Overview

The authentication system has been transformed from a monolithic approach to a modular, maintainable, and secure system following Domain-Driven Design principles. All business logic has been moved out of the API layer into domain services, with proper value objects, domain events, and clean separation of concerns.

## Key DDD Principles Applied

### 1. Domain Value Objects

The system uses rich domain value objects for input validation and business rules:

#### Username Value Object
```python
class Username:
    """Domain value object for usernames with validation and normalization."""
    
    def __init__(self, value: str):
        # Validation logic
        # Normalization (lowercase, trim)
        # Business rules enforcement
```

#### Password Value Object
```python
class Password:
    """Domain value object for passwords with strength validation."""
    
    def __init__(self, value: str):
        # Password strength validation
        # Business rules enforcement
        # Security requirements checking
```

#### Email Value Object
```python
class Email:
    """Domain value object for email addresses with validation."""
    
    def __init__(self, value: str):
        # Email format validation
        # Normalization (lowercase, trim)
        # Business rules enforcement
```

#### JWT Token Value Objects
```python
class AccessToken:
    """Domain value object for JWT access tokens."""
    
class RefreshToken:
    """Domain value object for JWT refresh tokens."""
```

#### Reset Token Value Object
```python
class ResetToken:
    """Domain value object for password reset tokens."""
    
    def __init__(self, value: str):
        # Token format validation
        # Expiration checking
        # Security requirements
```

### 2. Domain Events

The system publishes domain events for audit trails and security monitoring:

#### Authentication Events
```python
class UserLoggedInEvent(BaseDomainEvent):
    """Domain event published when user successfully logs in."""
    
class AuthenticationFailedEvent(BaseDomainEvent):
    """Domain event published when authentication fails."""
```

#### Password Reset Events
```python
class PasswordResetRequestedEvent(BaseDomainEvent):
    """Domain event published when password reset is requested."""
    
class PasswordResetCompletedEvent(BaseDomainEvent):
    """Domain event published when password reset is completed."""
```

### 3. Domain Interfaces

Clean interfaces define contracts for all services:

#### Repository Interfaces
```python
class IUserRepository(ABC):
    """Interface for user data access operations."""
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def get_by_username(self, username: str) -> Optional[User]:
        """Get user by username with value object support."""
```

#### Service Interfaces
```python
class IUserAuthenticationService(ABC):
    """Interface for user authentication service following DDD principles."""
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def authenticate_user(
        self,
        username: Username,
        password: Password,
        client_ip: str,
        user_agent: str,
        correlation_id: str,
    ) -> User:
        """Authenticate user with domain value objects and security context."""
```

### 4. Domain Services

Business logic is encapsulated in domain services:

#### User Authentication Service
```python
class UserAuthenticationService(IUserAuthenticationService):
    """Domain service for user authentication operations following DDD principles."""
    
    async def authenticate_user(
        self,
        username: Username,
        password: Password,
        client_ip: str,
        user_agent: str,
        correlation_id: str,
    ) -> User:
        """
        Authenticate user with domain value objects and security context.
        
        This method implements the core authentication business logic following
        Domain-Driven Design principles:
        
        1. Input Validation: Uses domain value objects (Username, Password)
        2. Business Rules: Enforces authentication rules and user state checks
        3. Security Context: Captures security-relevant information for audit
        4. Domain Events: Publishes events for security monitoring and audit trails
        5. Error Handling: Provides meaningful error messages in ubiquitous language
        6. Logging: Implements secure logging with data masking and correlation
        """
```

#### User Registration Service
```python
class UserRegistrationService(IUserRegistrationService):
    """Domain service for user registration operations."""
    
    async def register_user(
        self,
        username: Username,
        email: Email,
        password: Password,
    ) -> User:
        """Register new user with domain value objects."""
```

### 5. Infrastructure Services

Infrastructure layer provides concrete implementations:

#### Event Publisher
```python
class InMemoryEventPublisher(IEventPublisher):
    """In-memory implementation of event publisher for development."""
    
    async def publish(self, event: BaseDomainEvent) -> None:
        """Publish domain event for audit trails and monitoring."""
```

#### Token Service Adapter
```python
class TokenServiceAdapter(ITokenService):
    """Adapter for legacy token service to work with clean architecture."""
    
    async def create_token_pair(self, user: User) -> dict:
        """Create JWT token pair using legacy service."""
```

#### Password Reset Token Service
```python
class PasswordResetTokenService(IPasswordResetTokenService):
    """Infrastructure service for password reset token operations."""
    
    def generate_token(self, user: User) -> ResetToken:
        """Generate secure password reset token."""
```

### 6. Clean Architecture Dependencies

Dependency injection follows clean architecture principles:

```python
def get_user_authentication_service(
    user_repository: IUserRepository = Depends(get_user_repository),
    event_publisher: IEventPublisher = Depends(get_event_publisher),
) -> IUserAuthenticationService:
    """Factory that returns clean user authentication service."""
    return UserAuthenticationService(
        user_repository=user_repository,
        event_publisher=event_publisher,
    )
```

## API Layer Improvements

### Thin API Layer with No Business Logic

The login endpoint is now a thin API layer with no business logic:

```python
@router.post("", response_model=AuthResponse)
async def login_user(
    request: Request,
    payload: LoginRequest,
    auth_service: IUserAuthenticationService = Depends(CleanAuthService),
    token_service: ITokenService = Depends(CleanTokenService),
):
    """
    Authenticate a user with username and password using DDD principles.
    
    This endpoint implements a thin API layer that follows Domain-Driven Design
    and clean architecture principles:
    
    1. No Business Logic: All authentication logic is delegated to domain services
    2. Domain Value Objects: Uses Username and Password value objects for validation
    3. Security Context: Captures client IP, user agent, and correlation ID
    4. Domain Events: Authentication events are published by domain services
    5. Clean Error Handling: Proper handling of domain exceptions
    6. Secure Logging: Implements data masking and correlation tracking
    """
    # Generate correlation ID for request tracking
    correlation_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    
    # Extract security context from request
    client_ip = request.client.host or "unknown"
    user_agent = request.headers.get("user-agent", "unknown")
    
    # Create domain value objects for input validation
    username = Username(payload.username)
    password = Password(payload.password)
    
    # Delegate authentication to domain service
    user = await auth_service.authenticate_user(
        username=username,
        password=password,
        client_ip=client_ip,
        user_agent=user_agent,
        correlation_id=correlation_id,
    )
    
    # Create JWT tokens using domain token service
    tokens = await token_service.create_token_pair(user)
    
    # Return clean response
    return AuthResponse(
        tokens=tokens,
        user=UserOut.from_entity(user)
    )
```

## Repository Layer Improvements

### Enhanced User Repository

The user repository has been enhanced with DDD principles:

```python
class UserRepository(IUserRepository):
    """SQLAlchemy implementation of UserRepository following DDD principles."""
    
    async def get_by_username(self, username: str) -> Optional[User]:
        """
        Get user by username with value object support and case-insensitive search.
        
        This method supports both string and Username value object inputs,
        implementing proper validation and normalization following DDD principles.
        """
        # Handle both string and Username value object inputs
        if isinstance(username, Username):
            username_value = username.value
        else:
            # Validate string input
            if not username or not username.strip():
                raise ValueError("Username cannot be empty or whitespace-only")
            username_value = username.lower().strip()
        
        # Execute case-insensitive database query
        statement = select(User).where(User.username == username_value)
        result = await self.db_session.execute(statement)
        user = result.scalars().first()
        
        return user
```
