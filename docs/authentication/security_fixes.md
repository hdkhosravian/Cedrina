# Authentication Security Fixes

This document outlines critical security vulnerabilities that have been identified and fixed in the authentication system.

## CVE-2024-LOGOUT-001: Cross-User Refresh Token Revocation Vulnerability

### Problem Description

The `/auth/logout` endpoint had a critical security vulnerability that allowed users to revoke other users' refresh tokens. The endpoint failed to validate that the `refresh_token` provided in the request payload belonged to the `current_user` authenticated via the access token.

#### Attack Vector

1. An attacker authenticates with their own valid credentials and obtains an access token
2. The attacker obtains or guesses another user's valid refresh token
3. The attacker sends a logout request using:
   - Their own valid access token (for authentication)
   - Another user's refresh token (in the request payload)
4. The system would successfully revoke the other user's refresh token, effectively logging them out

#### Impact

- **Denial of Service**: Attackers could forcefully log out other users
- **Session Hijacking Prevention Bypass**: Users could terminate security incident response by revoking investigation tokens
- **User Experience Disruption**: Legitimate users would be unexpectedly logged out

### Solution

#### Code Changes

**File**: `src/adapters/api/v1/auth/routes/logout.py`

Added refresh token ownership validation before proceeding with token revocation:

```python
# SECURITY FIX: Validate refresh token ownership
# Decode the refresh token to extract the user_id and verify ownership
try:
    refresh_payload = jwt.decode(
        payload.refresh_token,
        settings.JWT_PUBLIC_KEY,
        algorithms=["RS256"],
        issuer=settings.JWT_ISSUER,
        audience=settings.JWT_AUDIENCE
    )
    refresh_token_user_id = int(refresh_payload["sub"])
    
    # Verify that the refresh token belongs to the authenticated user
    if refresh_token_user_id != current_user.id:
        await logger.awarning(
            "Attempted logout with mismatched refresh token",
            authenticated_user_id=current_user.id,
            refresh_token_user_id=refresh_token_user_id,
            username=current_user.username
        )
        raise AuthenticationError(get_translated_message("invalid_refresh_token", language))
        
except JWTError as e:
    await logger.awarning(
        "Invalid refresh token provided during logout",
        user_id=current_user.id,
        username=current_user.username,
        error=str(e)
    )
    raise AuthenticationError(get_translated_message("invalid_refresh_token", language)) from e
```

#### Security Improvements

1. **JWT Validation**: The refresh token is now properly decoded and validated before use
2. **Ownership Verification**: The user ID in the refresh token (`sub` claim) must match the authenticated user
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: Security events are logged for monitoring and forensics
4. **Error Handling**: Malformed or invalid tokens are properly rejected
5. **Consistent Error Messages**: All validation failures return the same generic error to prevent information leakage

#### Test Coverage

Added comprehensive security tests to prevent regression:

- `test_logout_rejects_other_users_refresh_token`: Verifies cross-user token revocation is prevented
- `test_logout_allows_own_refresh_token`: Ensures legitimate logout still works
- `test_logout_rejects_malformed_refresh_token`: Validates malformed token handling
- `test_logout_rejects_expired_refresh_token`: Ensures expired tokens are rejected

### Technical Details

#### JWT Token Structure

Refresh tokens contain the following relevant claims:
- `sub`: User ID (string representation)
- `jti`: JWT ID for token tracking
- `exp`: Expiration timestamp
- `iss`: Issuer (must match configured issuer)
- `aud`: Audience (must match configured audience)

#### Validation Flow

1. **Access Token Validation**: Authenticate the user via the access token
2. **Refresh Token Decoding**: Decode the refresh token using the public key
3. **Ownership Verification**: Compare `refresh_token.sub` with `current_user.id`
4. **Token Revocation**: Only proceed if ownership is confirmed

#### Error Scenarios

| Scenario | Response | Logged Event |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| Cross-user token | 401 Unauthorized | `Attempted logout with mismatched refresh token` |
| Malformed JWT | 401 Unauthorized | `Invalid refresh token provided during logout` |
| Expired token | 401 Unauthorized | `Invalid refresh token provided during logout` |
| Invalid signature | 401 Unauthorized | `Invalid refresh token provided during logout` |

### Prevention Measures

#### Code Review Guidelines

1. **Always validate token ownership** when accepting tokens from request payloads
2. **Never trust client-provided tokens** without server-side validation
3. **Implement comprehensive logging** for security-sensitive operations
4. **Use consistent error handling** to prevent information disclosure

#### Testing Requirements

All token-related endpoints must include tests for:
- Cross-user token scenarios
- Malformed token handling
- Expired token validation
- Proper ownership verification

#### Monitoring

The following log events should be monitored for security incidents:
- `Attempted logout with mismatched refresh token`
- `Invalid refresh token provided during logout`
- Multiple failed logout attempts from the same user/IP

### Deployment Considerations

This fix is backward compatible and does not require database migrations. However:

1. **Monitor logs** after deployment for any unexpected authentication failures
2. **Validate that legitimate logout flows** continue to work correctly
3. **Update client applications** if they were relying on the previous insecure behavior (which they shouldn't)

### Security Pattern Documentation

#### Standard Pattern for Token Ownership Validation

When accepting user tokens in request payloads, always follow this secure pattern:

```python
# SECURITY PATTERN: Token Ownership Validation
try:
    payload = jwt.decode(
        user_provided_token,
        settings.JWT_PUBLIC_KEY,
        algorithms=["RS256"],
        issuer=settings.JWT_ISSUER,
        audience=settings.JWT_AUDIENCE
    )
    token_user_id = int(payload["sub"])
    
    # CRITICAL: Validate that token belongs to authenticated user
    if token_user_id != current_user.id:
        await logger.awarning(
            "Cross-user token usage attempt",
            authenticated_user_id=current_user.id,
            token_user_id=token_user_id
        )
        raise AuthenticationError(get_translated_message("invalid_token", language))
        
except JWTError as e:
    await logger.awarning(
        "Invalid token provided",
        user_id=current_user.id,
        error=str(e)
    )
    raise AuthenticationError(get_translated_message("invalid_token", language)) from e
```

#### Future Endpoint Guidelines

If implementing new endpoints that handle refresh tokens:

**✅ SECURE Pattern** (Recommended):
```python
async def refresh_tokens_endpoint(payload: RefreshRequest):
    # Extract user from token itself - inherently secure
    return await token_service.refresh_tokens(payload.refresh_token)
```

**❌ VULNERABLE Pattern** (Never do this):
```python
async def refresh_tokens_endpoint(
    payload: RefreshRequest,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)  # ❌ Creates vulnerability
):
    # This creates cross-user attack vector
    # DON'T use current_user for token operations
```

#### Code Review Security Checklist

For any endpoint that accepts user tokens, verify:

- [ ] **Token Source Validation**: Does the endpoint extract user ID from the token itself?
- [ ] **Ownership Verification**: Does it validate token ownership before operations?
- [ ] **Error Consistency**: Are error messages consistent to prevent information disclosure?
- [ ] **Security Logging**: Is comprehensive logging in place for security monitoring?
- [ ] **JWT Validation**: Are all JWT claims (iss, aud, exp) properly validated?
- [ ] **Exception Handling**: Are JWTError exceptions properly caught and logged?

#### Testing Requirements

All token-handling endpoints must include:

- Cross-user token rejection tests
- Malformed token handling tests
- Expired token validation tests
- Proper ownership verification tests
- Security logging validation tests

### Related Security Best Practices

1. **Token Scope Validation**: Always verify that tokens are being used within their intended scope
2. **Resource Ownership**: Implement ownership checks for all user-specific operations
3. **Least Privilege**: Users should only be able to modify their own resources
4. **Security Logging**: Log all authentication and authorization events for monitoring

This fix represents a critical security improvement that prevents unauthorized session termination attacks while maintaining the usability of the authentication system.
