# Real-World Scenarios for Advanced Rate Limiting System

## Introduction

The Advanced Rate Limiting System in the `cedrina` project is designed to address real-world challenges faced by modern web applications. While the technical documentation (`advanced_rate_limiting_system.md`) provides an in-depth look at the system's architecture and components, this document focuses on practical, real-world scenarios to illustrate how the system operates under various conditions. These scenarios demonstrate the system's ability to protect resources, ensure fair usage, enhance security, and maintain performance.

This guide is intended for developers, product managers, and system administrators who want to understand how rate limiting applies to everyday use cases and business requirements in the context of the `cedrina` platform.

## Scenario 1: Protecting a Login Endpoint from Brute Force Attacks

### Context
A common security threat for web applications is brute force attacks on login endpoints, where malicious actors attempt multiple username/password combinations to gain unauthorized access. Without rate limiting, such attacks can overwhelm the system, degrade performance, or even succeed in compromising user accounts.

### How Rate Limiting Works Here
- **Policy Configuration**: In `cedrina`, a specific `RateLimitPolicy` is applied to the `/api/auth/login` endpoint with a strict quota, e.g., 10 requests per minute per client IP, with a burst allowance of 2 to handle brief spikes.
- **Key Generation**: The system generates a unique `RateLimitKey` for each client based on their IP address (`client_ip`), ensuring that limits are enforced per client rather than globally.
- **Algorithm Application**: Using the **Fixed Window** algorithm, the system counts login attempts within a 60-second window. If a client exceeds 10 requests, further attempts are denied until the window resets.
- **Outcome**: When a malicious user attempts 50 login requests in 30 seconds, the system blocks the excess requests after the 10th attempt, returning a `429 Too Many Requests` error with details on when the limit resets.
- **Security Benefit**: This prevents brute force attacks by making it impractical to guess passwords through rapid attempts, protecting user accounts and reducing server load.
- **Observability**: Metrics are collected on denied requests, allowing the security team to identify and investigate suspicious IP addresses.

### Real-World Impact
For an e-commerce platform like `cedrina`, this protection ensures that customer accounts remain secure during peak shopping seasons when attack attempts might increase. It also prevents server overload, maintaining a smooth experience for legitimate users.

## Scenario 2: Ensuring Fair Usage During a Product Launch

### Context
During a high-traffic event like a new product launch or a flash sale, an e-commerce platform can experience a surge in API requests as users rush to place orders or check inventory. Without controls, a few aggressive users or bots could monopolize the system, submitting hundreds of requests per second, while others are left waiting.

### How Rate Limiting Works Here
- **Hierarchical Policies**: `cedrina` applies hierarchical rate limits. A global policy limits total requests to `/api/products` to 10,000 per minute across all users to protect backend resources. Additionally, a user-specific policy limits each authenticated user to 20 requests per minute to ensure fairness.
- **Key Generation**: The system uses a combination of `user_id` and endpoint in the `RateLimitKey` to track individual user activity, while a global key tracks aggregate traffic.
- **Algorithm Application**: The **Token Bucket** algorithm is used for user-specific limits, allowing a small burst (e.g., 5 extra requests) for initial page loads or quick actions, while refilling tokens over time to prevent sustained high-frequency requests.
- **Outcome**: During a flash sale, a user trying to refresh product availability 30 times in a minute is throttled after their 20th request (plus burst allowance), receiving a `429` error. Meanwhile, the global limit prevents the entire system from being overwhelmed by bot traffic.
- **Fairness Benefit**: This ensures that all users have an equal chance to access the sale, preventing bots or aggressive users from dominating resources.
- **Resilience**: If Redis (used for distributed rate limiting) experiences issues, the system falls back to in-memory limiting with a circuit breaker, ensuring continued operation albeit with reduced accuracy.

### Real-World Impact
For `cedrina`, this means a successful product launch where thousands of customers can browse and purchase without delays caused by a few overactive users or bots, maintaining customer satisfaction and sales conversions.

## Scenario 3: Protecting Against Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks

### Context
A malicious actor launches a DoS attack against `cedrina`'s public API endpoints, flooding them with requests to disrupt service for legitimate users. Such attacks can cripple system performance, increase costs, and damage reputation if not mitigated.

### How Rate Limiting Works Here
- **Global Policy**: A global rate limit is set for all unauthenticated requests to public endpoints (e.g., 500 requests per minute per client IP) to catch broad attack patterns.
- **IP-Based Key**: The `RateLimitKey` is generated using the client's IP address (`client_ip`), ensuring that the limit applies per attacker even if they target multiple endpoints.
- **Algorithm Application**: The **Sliding Window** algorithm provides accurate counting of requests over a rolling 60-second window, preventing attackers from exploiting window resets (as in Fixed Window).
- **Outcome**: An attacker sending 2,000 requests in a minute from a single IP is throttled after 500, with subsequent requests blocked and logged as potential threats. Legitimate users from different IPs remain unaffected.
- **Security and Observability**: Metrics track the spike in denied requests, triggering alerts for the security team. Distributed tracing helps identify the attack pattern across endpoints.
- **Resilience**: The circuit breaker prevents cascading failures if Redis is overwhelmed by the attack traffic, falling back to in-memory limits temporarily.

### Real-World Impact
For a platform like `cedrina`, this protection minimizes downtime during an attack, ensuring that customer-facing services remain available. It also reduces infrastructure costs by preventing unnecessary scaling triggered by malicious traffic.

## Scenario 4: Differentiated Limits for User Roles During Peak Load

### Context
In a SaaS platform, different user tiers (e.g., free, premium, enterprise) have different access privileges to API resources. During peak load times, such as a major marketing campaign, the system must enforce stricter limits on free users while allowing premium users more access to maintain service quality for paying customers.

### How Rate Limiting Works Here
- **Role-Based Policies**: `cedrina` defines multiple `RateLimitPolicy` objects based on user roles. Free users are limited to 5 requests per minute on data-intensive endpoints, premium users to 50, and enterprise users to 200.
- **Policy Resolution**: The `RateLimitPolicyService` resolves the applicable policy by matching the `user_id` against role metadata in the request context, prioritizing the most specific (and generous) policy for higher-tier users.
- **Key Generation**: The `RateLimitKey` includes the `user_id` to track limits per user, ensuring accurate enforcement across distributed application instances via Redis.
- **Algorithm Application**: The **Fixed Window** algorithm is used for simplicity, resetting limits every minute to provide predictable access patterns for users.
- **Outcome**: During a marketing campaign, a free user is throttled after 5 requests to a reporting endpoint, while a premium user continues up to 50 requests without interruption. Enterprise clients experience no noticeable limits, ensuring their business operations are unaffected.
- **Observability**: Metrics differentiate rate limit outcomes by user role, allowing product teams to analyze usage patterns and adjust tiers if needed.

### Real-World Impact
For `cedrina`, this ensures that premium and enterprise customers receive the service quality they pay for, especially during high-traffic periods, while still allowing free users to trial the platform. This balance drives customer retention and upselling opportunities.

## Scenario 5: Temporary Access Restrictions During Maintenance

### Context
During a scheduled maintenance window, `cedrina` needs to restrict access to certain non-critical API endpoints to reduce load on the system while allowing critical operations (e.g., user authentication) to continue normally. This requires dynamic policy updates without restarting the application.

### How Rate Limiting Works Here
- **Dynamic Policy Updates**: The `RateLimitPolicyService` supports runtime policy updates. Administrators push a temporary policy via an admin endpoint, setting a very low quota (e.g., 1 request per minute) for non-critical endpoints like `/api/reports`.
- **Policy Caching and Invalidation**: The service invalidates cached policies and applies the new temporary limits immediately across all application instances using Redis pub/sub for synchronization.
- **Key Generation**: Limits are applied based on endpoint-specific `RateLimitKey` values, ensuring only targeted APIs are affected.
- **Algorithm Application**: The **Fixed Window** algorithm enforces the strict limit, blocking excess requests with a custom error message indicating maintenance.
- **Outcome**: During maintenance, users attempting to access reporting features receive a `429` error after their first request, with a message like "Endpoint temporarily limited due to maintenance. Retry after 60 seconds." Critical endpoints like login remain unaffected.
- **Resilience**: If Redis fails during policy propagation, the system gracefully degrades to the last known policy or in-memory defaults, ensuring no complete outage.

### Real-World Impact
For `cedrina`, this capability minimizes disruption during maintenance by prioritizing critical services, maintaining user trust, and allowing admins to manage system load dynamically without downtime.

## Scenario 6: Handling API Abuse by a Third-Party Integration

### Context
A third-party integration or partner application misbehaves, sending an unexpectedly high volume of requests to `cedrina`'s API (e.g., polling for updates every second instead of using webhooks). This abuse risks degrading performance for other users and increasing operational costs.

### How Rate Limiting Works Here
- **Client-Specific Policy**: A `RateLimitPolicy` is configured for third-party API clients, identified by a specific API key or client ID, limiting them to 30 requests per minute on data polling endpoints.
- **Key Generation**: The `RateLimitKey` incorporates a client identifier (e.g., API key hash) alongside the endpoint, ensuring limits are scoped to the offending integration without affecting others.
- **Algorithm Application**: The **Sliding Window** algorithm tracks requests over a rolling window, providing smooth rate control and preventing sudden resets that could be exploited.
- **Outcome**: The misbehaving integration is throttled after 30 requests in a minute, receiving `429` errors with retry-after headers. Other clients or users remain unaffected.
- **Security and Observability**: Sophisticated key generation prevents the client from bypassing limits by changing IPs. Metrics and logs highlight the abuse pattern, enabling the support team to contact the partner and suggest webhook adoption.

### Real-World Impact
For `cedrina`, this protects the platform from unintended abuse by partners, maintaining service quality for all users. It also provides data to educate third parties on proper API usage, fostering better ecosystem collaboration.
