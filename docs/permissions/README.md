# Permissions System Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Permissions System in Cedrina. This directory contains detailed information about how permissions are managed, enforced, and configured within the application.

## Overview

The Cedrina application uses a robust permission system based on Casbin, an open-source access control library. This system allows for fine-grained control over user access to resources, supporting Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), and more complex policy definitions.

## Navigation

- **[Core Concepts](./core_concepts.md)**: Understand the fundamental principles and components of the permission system.
- **[Configuration](./configuration.md)**: Learn how to configure the Casbin enforcer and policy files.
- **[Policy Management](./policy_management.md)**: Detailed guide on creating, updating, and managing access control policies.
- **[Enforcement Scenarios](./enforcement_scenarios.md)**: Explore various scenarios where permissions are enforced, including edge cases.
- **[API Integration](./api_integration.md)**: How the permission system integrates with the FastAPI endpoints.
- **[Testing and Validation](./testing_validation.md)**: Best practices for testing permissions in development and production environments.
- **[Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md)**: Common issues and their resolutions related to permissions.

## Getting Started

If you're new to the Cedrina permission system, start with the [Core Concepts](./core_concepts.md) to familiarize yourself with the basic building blocks. For developers looking to integrate permissions into new endpoints, the [API Integration](./api_integration.md) guide will be particularly useful.
