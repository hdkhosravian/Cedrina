# Test Database Setup and Configuration

## ✅ **COMPLETED: Test Database Configuration**

### **What Was Fixed**

1. **Alembic Configuration** (`alembic/env.py`)
   - Updated to use `DATABASE_URL` environment variable directly
   - Allows Makefile to control which database is migrated (dev vs test)

2. **Database Settings** (`src/core/config/database.py`)
   - Added `TEST_DATABASE_URL` field with proper validation
   - Added `EMAIL_CONFIRMATION_ENABLED` field for test configuration

3. **Makefile** (`Makefile`)
   - Fixed `db-migrate` target to properly handle both dev and test databases
   - Fixed `run-test` target to use test database URL directly
   - Removed unreliable `sed` commands in favor of direct URL construction

4. **Pytest Configuration** (`tests/conftest.py`)
   - Enhanced database cleanup for complete test isolation
   - Added test database verification fixture
   - Improved async session configuration for test database
   - Added rate limiting disable for tests

### **How It Works Now**

#### **Database Migration**
```bash
# This now works for both dev and test databases
make db-migrate
```

#### **Running Tests**
```bash
# Tests now use the test database exclusively
make run-test
```

#### **Test Database Isolation**
- Each test runs in complete isolation
- Database is cleaned between tests
- No test data persists between test runs

### **Current Test Status**

✅ **WORKING:**
- Test database connection and setup
- Database migrations for test database
- Test isolation and cleanup
- Basic test infrastructure

❌ **KNOWN ISSUES (Not related to database setup):**
- Some API endpoints return 422 validation errors instead of expected responses
- Rate limiting is still active in some tests
- Some configuration attributes are missing

### **Verification Commands**

```bash
# Verify both databases have tables
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d cedrina_dev -c '\dt'
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -d cedrina_test -c '\dt'

# Run tests (uses test database)
make run-test

# Run migrations for both databases
make db-migrate
```

### **Environment Variables**

The system now properly uses these environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Development database
- `TEST_DATABASE_URL` - Test database (auto-constructed from POSTGRES_* vars)
- `TEST_MODE` - Set to `true` during tests
- `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` - Set to `false` during tests

### **Database Cleanup**

Tests now perform comprehensive cleanup:
- Users with test patterns
- Sessions for test users
- OAuth profiles for test users
- Casbin rules for test data
- Audit logs for test data

This ensures complete test isolation and prevents test interference.
